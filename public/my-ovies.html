<h1>The Best Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>This according to the world's least qualified expert.</2>
<hr />
<h3>Casablanca</h3>
<p>Because...obviously. Just watch it. There's nothing more to say.</p>
<h3>A Fish Called Wanda</h3>
<p>Comic genius with some of the best performances from John Cleese, Marty Palin, Kevin Klein, and the amazing Jamie Lee Curtis</p>
<h3>Top Gun</h3>
<p>Best action movie. Try to ignore the egomaniac in the front seat. This role suits him. Can you
    say "typecast"?</p>
